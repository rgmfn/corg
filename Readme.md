# corg
An emacs org-file reader written with ncurses in C.

I personally use org files mostly for their list, todo, and agenda functionalities, so that is what is being prioritized.

# Quick start
* Dependencies
 - `ncurses`
 - `clang`
 - `make`
## Compilation
In corg/src, run make.
```
> make
```

## Running
Run command corg with the file path of an org file as the argument.
```
> ./corg /path/to/file.org
```

Additionally, you can run corg with no arguments to open a new, blank, unnamed file.
```
> ./corg
```
